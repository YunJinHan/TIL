Object-Oriented Paradigm builds on three import concepts
------------
1. **Objcets**
2. **Classes**
3. **Inheritance**
4. (Additional) **Polymorphism**

- Objects have **attributes** that help describe them
- Objects have externally observable behaviors<br>
(aka **Services - 사용자관점** or **Responsibilites - 객체관점(Interface, Type)**)
- Encapsulating state of object rather than expose it is good engineering<br>
(Encapsulation : separatino of inerface from implementation)
<br>
<br>

<br>
-> don't need to know how object will perform actions,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But need to know what messages it will understand
<br>
<br>
- Objects have **Unique Identities**<br>
(Identity is property of object distinguishes itself from all other objects)<br>
-> Don't confuse between the name (or handle) of object and object itself
<br>
<br>
- Objects communicate by sending **Messages (Request for action)**<br>
(Objects perform actions by making requests of each other through **messages**)
<br>
(there is a designated **Receiver (or target)** that accepts the messages)<br>
(the actual behavior performed by the receiver may be different,<br>
depending upon the **Type** of the **Receiver** => **Polymorphrism**)<br>

*(Method overloading -> Ad hoc polymorphrism)*
<br>
- Ask not what you can do to objects, but Ask what objects can do for you
<br>
<br>
- Class is a group of ojbects with similar **attributes** and **behavior**
<br>
<br>
- Class is a **Repository** for behavior and the internal representation of the associated objects
<br>
<br>
- Objects are created from classes through the process of **Instantiation(실체화)**
<br>
<br>
- Objects are actual **Instances** of a class<br>
ex) Classes are factories and objects are products from the factory<br>
-> the terms **instance** and **object** are **interchangeable**
<br>
<br>
- Object can have many types / Ojects of different classes can have same type
